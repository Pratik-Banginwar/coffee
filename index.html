                <h3>Information About Coffee</h3>
                <p>Coffee, beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plants of African origin. Coffee is one of the three most popular beverages in the world (alongside water and tea) and one of the most profitable international commodities. Though coffee is the basis for an endless array of beverages, including espresso, cappuccinos, mochas, and lattes, its popularity is mainly attributed to its invigorating effect, which is produced by caffeine, an alkaloid present in coffee.</p>

                <h3>Black Coffee</h3>
                <p>Black coffee is simply coffee that is normally brewed without the addition of additives such as sugar, milk, cream, or added flavors. While it has a slightly bitter taste compared to when it is flavored with additives, many people love a strong cup of black coffee. In fact, for some, it is part of their everyday diet. In this article, we talk about the benefits of drinking black coffee, how it can help you in losing weight, potential side effects, as well as how to make the perfect cup of black coffee. Simply put, drinking coffee only becomes a cause for concern when you drink it regularly with milk, sugar, cream, etc. With these additives, even a single cup of coffee can contain as many calories as an extra-large slice of cake.</p>

                <h3>Cold Coffee</h3>
                <p>Cold Coffee is a creamy and popular cold beverage that is made from 3 main ingredients - coffee, sugar, and cold milk shaken or blended well in a mixer grinder. Throw in a few ice cubes while blending for a frothy finish. This creamy, frothy drink is just the perfect indulgence on a hot summer day. It is served with ice and sometimes topped with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. So, while an Iced Coffee could be black and without sugar, the Classic Cold Coffee is typically milky and sweet.</p>
